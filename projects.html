          <h3>Terminology Integration for Engineering Documentation</h3>

             <p><b><u>Company / Client</u></b></p>
             <p><b><i>Ukrhydroproject </i></b> is one of Ukraine’s leading engineering design companies, with nearly a century of expertise in infrastructure for energy, water management, and industry. The company employs around 500 highly qualified specialists across more than 30 technical disciplines.</p>
             <p>Its core focus is the design of hydropower plants and hydraulic structures. Over 150 projects have been completed across Ukraine and abroad ranging from small HPPs to major dams and reservoirs. The company also develops pumping stations, irrigation systems, locks, and integrated water supply solutions for urban and industrial applications. Services span the full lifecycle: from site surveys and feasibility studies to design, reconstruction, and construction supervision. Quality management is ISO 9001 certified.</p>

            <p><b><u>Project / Product</u></b></p>
            <p>The <b><i>Terminology Integration for Engineering Documentation</i></b> initiative was developed in response to Ukrhydroproject’s expanding international activity. With projects delivered to clients in Asia, the Americas, and Africa, there emerged a need to accelerate translation timelines and ensure terminological consistency across complex, multidisciplinary designs.</p>
            <p>From geological investigations to hydraulic calculations, architectural design to environmental impact assessments, each project draws on an extensive range of technical expertise — making unified terminology a critical necessity.
            <p>Existing translation tools at the time offered little practical support for complex, multidisciplinary content, requiring extensive configuration and frequently delivering inconsistent output.</p>
            <p>The initiative resulted in unified engineering terminology across departments, supported by a structured collection of domain-specific glossaries integrated into the company’s digital infrastructure. Custom software tools (including a plugin for AutoCAD) were developed to reduce manual effort in preparing multilingual technical documentation. These innovations led to improved translation quality, significantly shortened turnaround times, and enhanced the company’s competitiveness on the global stage.</p>
            <p>In 2004, the Initiative's concept, implementation challenges, and results achieved were formally presented at the International Youth Scientific and Technical Conference (Kharkiv, Ukraine). The report, titled <i>“Modern Computer Technologies Used in Technical Documentation Translation”</i> served as both a technical overview and a public showcase of the project's innovations.</p>

            <p><b><u>Key Contributions</u></b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mapped cross-departmental documentation flows to identify recurring terminology and promote consistent usage</li>
              <li>Analyzed documentation workflows - both textual and graphical - to uncover semantic gaps between design drawings and explanatory notes</li>
              <li>Identified terminology inconsistencies across 30+ engineering disciplines involved in the design process, which were critical to maintaining translation accuracy</li>
              <li>Compiled bilingual glossaries in multiple working languages, aligned with domain-specific vocabulary and project needs</li>
              <li>Initiated and coordinated the rollout of glossary-access tools—including an AutoCAD plugin and an intranet-based interface—in collaboration with the IT team</li>
              <li>Contributed glossary content to the company’s internal English-language training program to support terminology retention and alignment across teams</li>

          <h3>Multilingual Support for Cross-Disciplinary Engineering Documentation</h3>

             <p><b><u>Company / Client</u></b></p>
             <p><b><i>Ukrhydroproject</i></b> is a Ukrainian engineering design institute, established in 1927. The company specializes in the development of hydropower and water infrastructure projects. Its portfolio includes hundreds of completed projects across Ukraine and in dozens of countries throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. It actively participates in international initiatives supported by ICOLD, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and has world-wide communications with the prominent companies of the field.</p>
             <p>In 2010, as part of a structural reorganization, the Multidisciplinary Design and Engineering Group “GRANT” (PIK GRANT) was formed on the basis of Ukrhydroproject. The group also includes HYDROTECHPROJECT LTD, UKRATOMENERGOPROJECT LTD, and the Interdepartmental Centre of Engineering Researches LTD. This integration consolidated expertise across hydrotechnical engineering, nuclear energy, environmental consulting, and site investigations, while fostering partnerships with global companies in related fields.</p>

            <p><b><u>Project / Product</u></b></p>
            <p>As Ukrhydroproject expanded its portfolio of foreign-funded contracts, the need emerged to formalize principles for translation project management and establish a scalable process for multilingual documentation. Hydropower facilities designed by the company are site-specific and technically unique, making translation challenging — yet individual documentation sets often included recurring content across stages such as Feasibility Study, Design, Detailed Design, and Construction Drawings.</p>
            <p>To optimize delivery, Trados CAT tools were implemented, enabling reuse of technical language and compilation of domain-specific glossaries. This approach supported terminological consistency across disciplines including electromechanical systems, telecommunications, architecture, geology, etc.</p>
            <p>Before the institute's reorganization into PIK GRANT, which effectively doubled the number of engineering specialties, the workflow had already demonstrated its efficiency and adaptability to increasing content volumes and complexity.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical documentation, in-house linguistic support also covered contract negotiations, office correspondence, bid preparation, marketing materials, and public-facing technical publications. To ensure consistent quality across this broad spectrum, the company formalized its ISO 9001-aligned internal standard for translation services — reinforcing the strategic importance of structured language workflows in multidisciplinary design environments.</p>

            <p><b><u>Key Contributions</u></b></p>
              <ul>
